# Memory Management in C

This repository contains various examples of C programming concepts, organized into different folders. Each folder focuses on a specific topic and includes one or more C files demonstrating key concepts.

## Folder Structure

### arrays
- `array.c`: Demonstrates the usage of arrays in C, including initialization, accessing elements, and iterating through an array using a for loop.

### structs
- `typedef.c`: Shows how to use structs with typedef in C, creating a custom `person_t` type and initializing it with designated initializers.
- `person.h`: (Implied) A header file containing the definition of the `person_t` struct.

### pointers
- `pointers_with_structs.c`: Illustrates the use of pointers with structs, including accessing struct members through pointers.
- `pointer.c`: Provides a basic introduction to pointers, including declaration, initialization, and dereferencing.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. Arrays
2. Structs and typedef
3. Pointers
4. Pointers with structs
5. Basic input/output using printf

## How to Compile and Run

To compile any of the C files, use a C compiler such as gcc.
